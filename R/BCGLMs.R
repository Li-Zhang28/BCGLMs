#' BCGLMs-package
#' @description BCGLMs-package provides functions to analyze compositional microbiome data.
#' We proposed to use a structured regularized horseshoe prior for the compositional coefficients and a soft sum-to-zero restriction on coefficients through the prior distribution.
#' We also provide phylogenetic similarity choice to capture the phylogenetic relatedness among taxa.
#' This package provides functions for setting up and fitting various Bayesian models for continuous, binary and ordinal response.
