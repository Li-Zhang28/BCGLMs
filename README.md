# BCGLMs: Bayesian Compostional GLMs for Analyzing Microbiome Data

# Overview

This R package provide Functions for fitting Bayesian compositional models for analyzing microbiome data, including generalized linear models (GLMs), cumulative logistic model.
We employ a structured regularized horseshoe prior for the compositional coefficients and a soft sum-to-zero restriction on coefficients through the prior distribution. 
The models are fitted using efficient Hamiltonian Monte Carlo algorithm.
